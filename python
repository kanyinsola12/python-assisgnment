# Step 1: File Creation
# Creates a new text file and writes three lines of text
with open('my_file.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write("This is line 1\n")
    file.write("12345\n")
    file.write("Hello, this is line 3\n")

# Step 2: File Reading and Display
# Reads the contents of the file and displays them
with open('my_file.txt', 'r') as file:
    contents = file.read()
    print("Contents of my_file.txt:")
    print(contents)

# Step 3: File Appending
# Appends three additional lines to the file
with open('my_file.txt', 'a') as file:
    file.write("Appending line 4\n")
    file.write("67890\n")
    file.write("Appending line 6\n")

# Reads the updated contents of the file and displays them again
with open('my_file.txt', 'r') as file:
    contents = file.read()
    print("Updated contents of my_file.txt:")
    print(contents)
